## Bugs
Is some known bugs in my project :
   * Duplicate ID , but i followed the example from the course when creating this project.
   * Element li not allowed as child of element nav in this context, i followed the example from the course when creating this project.
## Static files

I hosted the static files for this project on [AWS](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/) by creating an account, bucket, group, user, and connected with heroku is displaying all my static files, also created a folder media and uploaded all my images.

## Secure payment

I used [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs) for payment proccess as it is one of the safest financial service for e-commerce websites.

## Deployment

The project is hosted on Heroku. For it to run correctly the following is required:

* A Procfile that instructs Heroku how to run the app.

* requirements.txt. This file informs Heroku what dependencies are required to run the app correctly. It is created by typing on the terminal pip freeze > requirements.txt.

* Create a new app in Heroku

Setup in Heroku the environment variables required to successfully run the app in Settings, Config Vars.

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* DATABASE_URL
* EMAIL_HOST_PASS
* EMAIL_HOST_USER
* SECRET_KEY
* STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
* STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
* STRIPE_WH_SECRET
* USE_AWS

Connect Heroku to the project's repository on Github and setup automatic deployment. Heroku then will build a new version of the app every time a new deployment is pushed to Github.
